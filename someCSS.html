		<p class="ex1">My name is Narissa Kunkudatharn. I am 18 years old and I am currently a freshman student at the University of Washington, Seattle. I was born and brought up in Bangkok, Thailand and attended NIST International School for 15 years. Coming to Seattle after living in Bangkok for my whole life was a huge change because even though they are both cities they are very different. In Bangkok, there is a lot of culture from the people, while in Seattle its very liberal. For example, in Thailand we all have the values and attitude towards our monarchy. Also, Bangkok is a more fast paced and loud city, while Seattle is slow paced and a quieter city. However, I have only been here for almost 5 months. Thus, I have another 3+ years to explore Seattle and to make it as comfortable as Bangkok is to me.

		<p class="ex2">In my house, watching football (soccer) is like a ritual, my brother and I would wake up at the oddest time of the day to watch it. We would usually watch the English Premier League or La Liga. However, for both leagues my brother and I like different teams that are rivals of one another. So far, in my life I have watched 7 football matches live and have enjoyed every single one of them. This is because football has a culture of its own, everybody is cheering extremely loud and the reaction to each and every second of the match is the same on everybodyâ€™s faces, thus watching it live makes it 10 times better than watching it on TV.
