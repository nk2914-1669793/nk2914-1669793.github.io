		Hey, my name is Narissa Kunkudatharn and I a freshman student from Bangkok, Thailand. So far I have had an awesome first quarter and the University of Washington and I am looking forward to the coming quarters. My favorite hobbies are swimming, basketball, guitar, sleeping, dancing (only for fun) and eating. My favorite cuisine would be Thai with Italian coming in to a close second. Below are a couple of videos and photos that represent what I like.
